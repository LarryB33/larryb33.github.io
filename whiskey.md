# Irish Whiskey

Whether you're an avid whiskey drinker, or a novice taking their first sips, Irish whiskies make a great option.

## A Quick History of Irish Whiskey

Whiskey making in Ireland dates back, at least to the 15th Century. In fact the word "whiskey" comes from the Gaelic phrase *uisce beatha* (pronounced *Ish-key Bee-tha*), which means "water of life". 

Originally distilled by Irish monks in monasteries for *medicinal purposes*, this early take on whiskey would have likely been a variation on what we call moonshine today, a harsh spirit with herbs and spices added for flavor.

By the 16th Century, whiskey had moved out of the monasteries and was made all over the country. In 1608, King James I granted a whiskey licence to Sir Thomas Phillips. He used this licence to open the Bushmills Distillery in County Antrim. Bushmills is still made today, making it the oldest distillery in the world.

By the end of the 19th Century, thanks to improvements in distilling techniques and the global influence of the British Empire, Irish whiskey had become the most consumed spirit in the world.

A combination of political and economic factors, along with increased production of whiskey in other parts of the world, contributed to a decline in the production and popularity of Irish whiskey in the 20th Century. In the 1880's, there were 28 distilleries operating in Ireland. A century later, the only Irish whiskey labels were: Jameson, Powers, Cork, New Middleton, and Busmills.

However, the last 20 years have seen a resurgence in Irish whiskey. Today, there are 25 disilleries producing in Ireland.


## Characteristics of Irish Whiskey

The Irish are very particular about their whiskey. To be considered a true Irish whiskey, the Irish Department of Agriculture has made a list of requirements:

Irish whiskey must:

  - Be destilled and aged in Ireland.
  - Be made from a mash of malted grains or cereals.
  - Fermented with yeast.
  - Have an alcohol content of at least 40%, but less than 95%.
  - Aged for at least 3 years in wooden casks.

That last one is important. Some spirits, like rum, vodka, and gin, are able to be consumed more or less as soon as they're distilled. However, whiskey has more in common with wine in that it needs to be properly aged to be enjoyed.

When first distilled, whiskey is a clear liquid that has a strong burning alchohol taste. Storing it in wooden casks for at least 3 years, gives the whiskey time to develop. As it ages, the whiskey will lose that harsh burn and develop a smoother flavor. It will also absorb some new characteristics from the barrel itself. Barrel aging is what gives whiskey its rich gold color and warm, oakey flavor.

However, a big difference between wine and whiskey is, that while a wine will continue to mature after it's been bottled, whiskey stops developing as soon as it leaves the barrel. Therefore, as a general rule, the longer a whiskey is left in the cask, the smoother and more complex the flavor will be.

## How To Appreciate Irish Whiskey

Everyone knows how to taste whiskey right? You just take your glass, yell "Slainte!" and knock it back, right. **WRONG!** This ain't a shot of Fireball in a frat house, champ. This is *Irish Whiskey*. It's liquid art, handed down by God himself to the only people that could be trusted with it. And it's meant to be enjoyed properly with all of your senses.


**The Glass** - Ideally, one should drink whiskey from a bulb-shaped glass. This will allow you to better assess it's color, aroma (also called its "nose"), and body. The glass should be filled about halfway, to the widest part of the glass.

**Color** - The first thing you will notice about Irish whiskey is the color. Depending on how it's aged, Irish whiskey can vary in color from a pale gold to a dark, rich amber. A darker color generally indicates a richer, more complex flavor, while a lighter colored whiskey with have a lighter flavor. To best assess the color, hold your glass up to a light and swirl it gently.

**Body** - While you're swirling your whiskey, don't forget to assess its viscosity, or thickness. In other words, as you tip your glass, does the residue cling to the side? This will give you some idea of how the whiskey's texture when you drink it. A thicker whiskey is going to have a heavy flavor that coats your pallatte, while a thinner whiskey will have a light, crisp texture.

**Aroma** - Whiskies can have very complex scents, so breathe it in deep! Take your time and really try to describe the scents that jump out to you. The more time you spend taking in the complex aroma, the more notes you will be able to detect. Many Irish whiskies have a sweet aromas that might remind you of vanilla, fruitiness (citrus, cherry, apple, or plum), or honey. You might also notice some denser woody and/or smokey notes. Finally, many whiskeys have a slightly spicy, peppery, or herbal scent hidden in there as well.

**Taste** - Finally! It's time to actually taste the whiskey.

If you took your time in the previous steps, you probably already have a good idea of how it's going to taste. The color should give you an idea of its richness, the body gives hints about the texture, and the aroma will indicate the complexity of flavor and what notes to expect. Tasting is where it all comes together.

Like we said before, this isn't something you should knock back in one gulp. This should be done gradually.

Take a small sip. Does the richness and texture match what you were expecting?

Swish it around a little? Are you finding all of those flavor notes that came out in the aroma? Are you picking up anything new that you weren't expecting?

Take another sip. This time, try and suck in a little more air. Maybe hold it in your mouth a little longer before you swallow. Does that change anything?

Try another sip. But maybe before you do, add just a tiny drop of water or two to the whiskey. Some people think this opens up the flavor a little. What do you think?
