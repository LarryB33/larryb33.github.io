                <p>Shamrock Jack’s Irish Pub is an Irish family-owned Irish Pub and Restaurant blending the magical spirit of Ireland with contemporary food and drink. We are located just a few minutes north of the City of Rochester in Sea Breeze, New York, a bustling resort community on the shores of beautiful Lake Ontario.</p>
                <p>The Petzing family transformed a spacious Victorian home and ballroom dance studio into a Pub and Restaurant, featuring 3 dining rooms; a spacious Main Dining Room, a quaint library room and another room in the back named the vineyard for the unique wine rack built into the wall.</p>
                <p>We have recently added a front patio and porch which which makes for delightful dining and drinks on a warm summer day with the exciting sounds of the Seabreeze amusement park in the background. Just inside the front entrance is a door where the resident Leprechaun calls home.  It is not uncommon to see kids gathered around trying to catch a glimpse of this fabled character.</p>
                <p>We pride ourselves on being family friendly - "kids" of all ages are welcome - at night time the pub becomes a friendly hangout for the 21 and over crowd where live music or sports are often part of the atmosphere.  Notre Dame is a huge part of our Fall sports lineup - We even had a visit from Notre Dame Coach Brian Kelly thanks to our favorite sports family - the Jones's whose two sons Jamir and Jarron who play/played Notre Dame Football!</p>

          <h3>In The Spotlight</h3>
          <hr>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p>It’s been voted the best Irish pub in the Rochester area and now the family that owns Shamrock Jack’s say they feel honored and humbled.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
              <p>Owners say it’s the kind, welcoming family atmosphere that keeps customers loyal along with the made-from-scratch shepherd’s pie.</p>

          <br>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p>The Petzing family renovated an old house and turned it into a bar and built everything from the ground up. Those are just some of the many reasons why they won Rochester Rocs.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
              <p>Mike Petzing said, “To be recognized with this kind of award kind of makes us look back at the last 10 years that we’ve been here and it kind of makes it all worth it. We put literally blood, sweat and tears in here.”</p>

              <p>"It was a very busy Friday night, but we were seated right away, in the "library". Our server Tiara was at our table almost immediately, and was very attentive in spite of handling many other diners. My husband had the Philly cheesesteak and he said it was very, very good. A fun pub, with lots of nooks and crannies. We have enjoyed many other lunches and dinners there, and will continue to go back for the food & atmosphere."</p>
